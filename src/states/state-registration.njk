<h2 id="new-vehicle">Registering a New Vehicle in {{ state.name }}</h2>

<p>When you purchase a new vehicle from a dealership in {{ state.name }}, the dealer typically handles the title and registration paperwork on your behalf. However, it helps to understand the process and know what to expect:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Complete the sale.</strong> The dealer will collect the necessary sales tax or use tax at the time of purchase and submit the title application to the state.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide proof of insurance.</strong> You must have valid auto insurance meeting {{ state.name }}'s minimum requirements ({{ state.insuranceMinimum }}) before the vehicle can be registered.</li>
  <li><strong>Receive temporary plates.</strong> The dealer will issue temporary tags that allow you to drive the vehicle while your permanent registration and plates are processed.</li>
  <li><strong>Receive your title and registration.</strong> Your permanent registration card and license plates will be mailed to you or available for pickup at your local DMV, typically within 4-8 weeks.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="used-vehicle">Registering a Used Vehicle in {{ state.name }}</h2>

<p>If you purchase a used vehicle from a private seller in {{ state.name }}, you will need to handle the registration and title transfer yourself. Gather the following documents and visit your local DMV or tag office:</p>

<h3>Required Documents</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Signed title (certificate of origin):</strong> The seller must sign the title over to you, including the odometer reading and sale price.</li>
  <li><strong>Bill of sale:</strong> A written record of the transaction including the date, price, vehicle description, and both parties' signatures.</li>
  <li><strong>Valid photo ID:</strong> Your driver's license or state-issued identification card.</li>
  <li><strong>Proof of insurance:</strong> A current insurance card or policy declaration page showing coverage that meets {{ state.name }}'s requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Lien release (if applicable):</strong> If the previous owner had a loan on the vehicle, a lien release from the lender is required.</li>
  {% if state.hasEmissions %}<li><strong>Emissions test certificate:</strong> A valid emissions test result may be required before registration in applicable {{ state.name }} counties.</li>{% endif %}
  {% if state.hasSafetyInspection %}<li><strong>Safety inspection certificate:</strong> A current safety inspection is required for registration in {{ state.name }}.</li>{% endif %}

</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="title-transfer">Title Transfer in {{ state.name }}</h2>

<p>When a vehicle changes ownership in {{ state.name }}, the title must be transferred to the new owner. The title fee is <strong>{{ state.titleFee }}</strong>. Here are important things to know:</p>

  <li>If the title is lost, the seller must apply for a duplicate title before the vehicle can be transferred.</li>

  <li>Out-of-state titles are accepted but may require additional verification steps.</li>
</ul>
