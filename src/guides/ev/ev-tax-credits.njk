<h2 id="federal-new">Federal New EV Tax Credit</h2>

<p>The federal Clean Vehicle Credit, established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and updated through 2026, offers a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a new qualifying electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid. This credit is one of the most significant financial incentives available for EV buyers and can substantially reduce the effective purchase price of an electric vehicle.</p>

<p>The credit is structured in two components of $3,750 each. The first $3,750 requires that a specified percentage of the critical minerals used in the vehicle's battery must be extracted or processed in the United States or a country with a free trade agreement. The second $3,750 requires that a specified percentage of battery components must be manufactured or assembled in North America. A vehicle may qualify for the full $7,500, only one half ($3,750), or neither, depending on its supply chain compliance.</p>

<p>These requirements increase over time, meaning fewer vehicles may qualify for the full credit in later years. The IRS publishes an updated list of qualifying vehicles and their credit amounts on a quarterly basis. Always verify the current status of a specific vehicle before making a purchase decision based on the credit.</p>

<h2 id="federal-used">Federal Used EV Tax Credit</h2>

<p>The IRA also created a first-ever federal tax credit for used electric vehicles, making EVs more accessible to a broader range of buyers. The used EV credit offers up to $4,000 or 30% of the sale price, whichever is less, for qualifying pre-owned electric vehicles.</p>

<p>To qualify for the used EV credit, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The vehicle must be purchased from a licensed dealer (not a private party sale)</li>
<li>The sale price must be $25,000 or less</li>
<li>The vehicle must be at least 2 model years old at the time of sale</li>
<li>The vehicle must be a qualifying plug-in electric vehicle or fuel cell vehicle</li>
<li>The vehicle has not previously been transferred under this credit to another taxpayer</li>
<li>The buyer must meet income eligibility requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>The used EV credit is particularly valuable for making electric vehicles accessible to middle-income families. A 3-year-old EV priced at $20,000 with a $4,000 credit effectively costs $16,000, making it competitive with comparable used gas-powered vehicles.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility">Income and Price Limits</h2>

<p>Both the new and used EV tax credits have income eligibility caps based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) from the prior year or the year of purchase, whichever is less:</p>

<h3>New Vehicle Income Limits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Married filing jointly: $300,000</li>
<li>Head of household: $225,000</li>
<li>Single filer: $150,000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Used Vehicle Income Limits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Married filing jointly: $150,000</li>
<li>Head of household: $112,500</li>
<li>Single filer: $75,000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vehicle MSRP Caps (New Vehicles Only)</h3>
<ul>
<li>SUVs, vans, and pickup trucks: $80,000 maximum MSRP</li>
<li>All other vehicles (sedans, hatchbacks, wagons): $55,000 maximum MSRP</li>
</ul>

<p>The IRS classifies vehicles based on their EPA fuel economy classification, not how the manufacturer markets them. This means some vehicles that consumers think of as SUVs may be classified differently for credit purposes. Verify the classification on the IRS website or fueleconomy.gov before purchasing.</p>

<h2 id="qualifying-vehicles">Qualifying Vehicles for 2026</h2>

<p>The list of qualifying vehicles changes quarterly as manufacturers adjust their supply chains. As of early 2026, vehicles that have recently qualified for some or all of the federal credit include select models from these manufacturers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Model 3, Model Y (US-assembled, specific configurations)</li>
<li><strong>Chevrolet:</strong> Equinox EV, Blazer EV, Bolt (while supplies last)</li>
<li><strong>Ford:</strong> F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E (select configurations)</li>
<li><strong>Rivian:</strong> R1T, R1S (select configurations)</li>
<li><strong>Chrysler/Stellantis:</strong> Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Grand Cherokee 4xe</li>
<li><strong>BMW:</strong> Select plug-in hybrid models</li>
<li><strong>Cadillac:</strong> LYRIQ</li>
<li><strong>Honda:</strong> Prologue (select configurations)</li>
</ul>

<p>Always check the most current IRS listing before purchasing, as eligibility can change at any time based on supply chain and manufacturing updates.</p>

<h2 id="point-of-sale">Point-of-Sale Transfer Option</h2>

<p>One of the most significant changes introduced by the IRA is the ability to transfer your tax credit to the dealer at the point of sale. This effectively reduces the purchase price of the vehicle immediately, rather than requiring you to wait until you file your tax return to receive the credit as a refund.</p>

<p>Here is how the point-of-sale transfer works:</p>

<ol>
<li>The dealer verifies the vehicle qualifies for the credit and confirms your income eligibility.</li>
<li>You sign a transfer election form at the time of purchase, assigning the credit to the dealer.</li>
<li>The dealer reduces the purchase price of the vehicle by the credit amount (up to $7,500 for new or $4,000 for used).</li>
<li>The dealer claims the credit directly from the IRS.</li>
<li>You do not need to have $7,500 in tax liability to benefit from the full credit amount.</li>
</ol>

<p>This transfer option is particularly valuable for buyers with lower tax liability, who previously might not have been able to use the full credit amount. It also provides immediate financial benefit rather than requiring you to wait months for a tax refund.</p>

<h2 id="state-incentives">State-Level Incentives</h2>

<p>Many states offer additional incentives that stack on top of the federal credit, potentially saving you $10,000-$15,000 or more on an EV purchase. State incentives come in several forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Direct rebates:</strong> Cash back at the time of purchase or shortly after. States like Colorado, Oregon, and New Jersey offer some of the most generous rebates.</li>
<li><strong>State tax credits:</strong> Credits applied to your state tax return, similar to the federal credit.</li>
<li><strong>Sales tax exemptions:</strong> Some states, like New Jersey and Washington, exempt EVs from sales tax, which can save thousands on expensive vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced registration fees:</strong> Lower annual registration costs for EVs in certain states.</li>
<li><strong>HOV lane access:</strong> Many states allow solo EV drivers to use high-occupancy vehicle lanes, which can save significant commute time.</li>
<li><strong>Utility incentives:</strong> Electric utility companies in many states offer rebates for home charger installation and discounted overnight charging rates.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-claim">How to Claim Your Credits</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Verify eligibility.</strong> Confirm that both you and the vehicle meet all requirements before purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase from a licensed dealer.</strong> Both the new and used EV credits require purchase from a registered dealer.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain required documentation.</strong> The dealer must provide a time-of-sale report confirming the vehicle qualifies. Keep your purchase agreement, financing documents, and dealer certification.</li>
<li><strong>Choose your claim method.</strong> Either transfer the credit to the dealer at the point of sale for an immediate price reduction, or claim the credit on your federal tax return using IRS Form 8936.</li>
<li><strong>File Form 8936.</strong> If claiming on your return, complete IRS Form 8936 and include it with your federal tax filing for the year of purchase.</li>
</ol>
