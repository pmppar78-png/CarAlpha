    <div class="prose-dark">
      <h2>On the Vehicle</h2>

      <h3>Dashboard (Driver's Side)</h3>
      <p>The most common VIN location is the lower-left corner of the dashboard, visible through the windshield from outside the vehicle. Stand outside the driver's side door and look at the area where the dashboard meets the windshield. You should see a metal plate with 17 characters stamped or printed on it. This location was mandated by federal law starting with the 1969 model year.</p>

      <h3>Driver's Side Door Jamb</h3>
      <p>Open the driver's side door and look at the area where the door latches to the body of the vehicle. There is typically a sticker or label that contains the VIN along with other information like the vehicle's gross weight rating, tire pressure specifications, and paint color code. This is often the easiest VIN to read because it is protected from weather and UV exposure.</p>

      <h3>Engine Block</h3>
      <p>Most vehicles have the VIN stamped directly into the engine block, usually on the front of the engine near where it bolts to the transmission. This VIN is used by law enforcement to verify vehicle identity even if dashboard and door jamb VINs have been tampered with. Finding this VIN may require a flashlight and some knowledge of your engine layout.</p>

      <h3>Frame Rail</h3>
      <p>Trucks and body-on-frame vehicles often have the VIN stamped into the frame rail, which is the main structural member that runs the length of the vehicle. This is typically located near the front of the vehicle on the driver's side. Like the engine block VIN, this serves as an additional verification point.</p>

      <h3>Under the Spare Tire</h3>
      <p>Some manufacturers stamp the VIN into the floor of the trunk or cargo area, hidden beneath the spare tire. This location is less common in modern vehicles but was prevalent in older models.</p>

      <h3>Inner Wheel Well</h3>
      <p>Certain vehicles have the VIN stamped on the inner fender or wheel well area. This is more common in trucks and SUVs and may require turning the steering wheel or removing a wheel well liner to access.</p>

      <h2>On Documents</h2>

      <h3>Vehicle Title (Certificate of Title)</h3>
      <p>Your vehicle's title document prominently displays the VIN. The title is the legal document that establishes ownership and is issued by your state's Department of Motor Vehicles. If you have a lien on the vehicle, the lender typically holds the title until the loan is paid off.</p>

      <h3>Vehicle Registration Card</h3>
      <p>Your current vehicle registration card includes the VIN. In most states, you are required to carry your registration card in the vehicle at all times. The registration is typically renewed annually and serves as proof that the vehicle is legally registered in the state.</p>

      <h3>Insurance Card and Policy</h3>
      <p>Your auto insurance documents list the VIN for every vehicle covered under your policy. This can be found on your insurance card, the declarations page of your policy, or in your online insurance account. This is a convenient way to look up your VIN without going to the vehicle.</p>

      <h3>Bill of Sale or Purchase Agreement</h3>
      <p>If you purchased the vehicle from a dealership, the sales contract and bill of sale include the VIN. Dealerships are required to record the VIN on all sales documents as part of federal record-keeping requirements.</p>

      <h3>Service Records</h3>
      <p>Any repair or service records from a dealership or independent shop should include the VIN. Oil change receipts, repair invoices, and warranty service records all typically list the VIN as a vehicle identifier.</p>

      <h2>Online</h2>

      <h3>Insurance Company Website</h3>
      <p>Log into your auto insurance account online to find the VIN listed for each insured vehicle. Most major insurance companies display this information prominently in your policy details.</p>

      <h3>Loan or Lease Portal</h3>
      <p>If you have a car loan or lease, your lender's online portal will display the VIN for the financed vehicle. This information is available through services like Capital One Auto, Ally Financial, and other auto lenders.</p>

      <h3>DMV Online Services</h3>
      <p>Many states now offer online access to your vehicle registration information, which includes the VIN. Check your state's DMV website for online services availability.</p>

      <h2>Tips for Reading a VIN</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>VINs are always exactly 17 characters for vehicles manufactured after 1981</li>
        <li>VINs never contain the letters I, O, or Q</li>
        <li>If a character is hard to read, compare it against other VIN locations on the vehicle</li>
        <li>When copying a VIN, double-check that you have not confused 0 (zero) with O, 1 (one) with I, or 8 with B</li>
        <li>Take a photo of the VIN plate for future reference</li>
      </ul>
