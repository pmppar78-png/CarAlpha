{% else %}
<p>Car insurance rates in {{ state.name }} vary significantly based on several factors:</p>
{% endif %}

<ul>
  <li><strong>Driving record:</strong> Clean records qualify for the lowest rates. A single at-fault accident can increase premiums by 20-40%.</li>
  <li><strong>Age and experience:</strong> Drivers under 25 and over 70 typically pay more. The lowest rates are generally available to drivers aged 30-60.</li>
  <li><strong>Vehicle type:</strong> Newer, more expensive vehicles cost more to insure. Safety features and good crash test ratings can help lower rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit score:</strong> In most states, including {{ state.name }}, insurers use credit-based insurance scores as a rating factor.</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> Urban areas with higher traffic density and theft rates typically have higher premiums than rural areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Coverage level:</strong> Higher deductibles lower premiums, while comprehensive and collision coverage adds cost but protects your vehicle.</li>

<h2 id="tips">Tips to Save on Car Insurance in {{ state.name }}</h2>

<p>There are several proven strategies to reduce your car insurance costs in {{ state.name }} without sacrificing the coverage you need:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Compare at least 3-5 carriers.</strong> Rates vary dramatically between insurers for the same coverage. Shopping around is the single most effective way to save money.</li>
  <li><strong>Bundle policies.</strong> Many carriers offer discounts of 10-25% when you combine auto and home or renters insurance.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask about discounts.</strong> Good driver, good student, military, professional organization, and low-mileage discounts are widely available but not always automatically applied.</li>
  <li><strong>Raise your deductible.</strong> Increasing your deductible from $250 to $1,000 can lower your premium by 15-30%. Just make sure you can afford the deductible if you need to file a claim.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain a clean record.</strong> Avoiding tickets and accidents is the best long-term strategy for low rates. Many states offer point reduction courses.</li>
  <li><strong>Review your coverage annually.</strong> As your vehicle ages, you may want to drop comprehensive and collision coverage if the car's value no longer justifies the premium cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider telematics programs.</strong> Many insurers offer usage-based insurance programs that can save safe drivers 10-40% by tracking driving behavior.</li>
</ol>
